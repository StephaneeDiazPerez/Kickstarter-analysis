# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
*The purpose of this analysis is to give Elouise different types of data regarding her campaign. To be able to compare and contrast with the data provided and that includes being able to see charts and graphs, if provided.  

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
•	To the best of my abilities, I tried to analyze the data and use the correct formula, not quite sure where I went wrong that I kept getting 0 on my data.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
•	Throughout this whole challenge I experienced many obstacles and difficulties that left me feeling discouraged and stressed. On my first try I thought I was doing everything step by step until I reached 1.5.1: Measures of Central Tendency, after that while getting help from peers and the TA, was told I was missing data. Which resulted in having to start from the beginning and once again re-follow step by step. I also had to learn my way around using excel on a mac, which I noticed is by far different from windows. I kept going despite the setbacks and struggles.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
•	In 2015 & 2016 in the parent category: Théâtre it was canceled 12 times and the failed 202 in 2015, and in 2016 failed 130. Compared from 2010 until 2016 the amount of successful and failed peaked in 2015. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
•	N/A

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	Needs more seperation with having so many parent categories, subcategoriees, and category statistics. Either with seperate worksheets with their own graphs. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
•	Pie graphs with percentages with parent categories + successful, failed, canceled, and the years within pie graph
